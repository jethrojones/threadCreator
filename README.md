# Thread Creator
This turns your note into a X (or other) thread. 

Just select either the whole note or selected text and use the command palette to invoke "Tweet Thread: Convert note to Twitter thread" and it will create a new file in the folder TwitterThreads where you can then adjust as you post to your desired social network. 

To install this plugin, go to [https://github.com/jethrojones/threadCreator](https://github.com/jethrojones/threadCreator) and download the files as a zip. 

Unzip the files and move the folder into your .obsidian/plugins folder at the root of your vault folder. 

Hope you like this! 

Much love, 

Jethro
