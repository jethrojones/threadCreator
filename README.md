# Thread Creator
This turns your note into a X (or other) thread. 

Just select either the whole note or selected text and use the command palette to invoke "Tweet Thread: Convert note to Twitter thread" and it will create a new file in the folder TwitterThreads where you can then adjust as you post to your desired social network. 

Hope you like this! 

Much love, 

Jethro
